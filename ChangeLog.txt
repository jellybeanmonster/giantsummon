Inverted the order of factors when handling companion body and arms animations.
	Instead of setting up the arms animations first, and then the body, now It sets up the body animations first, and then the arms.
	Due to this change, I can remove 2 flags from many scripts.
Disabled Vote button on the Guardian Selection Interface, since there will be no contest.
Fixed a problem where a request accepted message could have the chance of being shown, when you complete Nemesis requests.
Added missing verb to the death by giving up message, and also added a variant to the death message.
Changed the Death by lava damage message on companions.
Companions will no longer "brick" when unarmed.
Companions will now behave better when attacking with melee weapons.
Fixed a bug where the companion would not use the left (right) arm correctly when swimming.
If Leopold is able to swim, he'll no longer play the long jumping animation when underwater.
You can now reject requests from Sardine.
Death due to Electrified debuff is no longer gender bound.
Your companions will no longer go "Steve" when trying to attack a monster without having any weapon in the inventory, so they will no longer spam attack independing on distance until the target is dead.
Reduced the Assist and Snipe ranged attack distances from the companion.
	Assist: Instead of 268 pixels, the companion will only stay away from the target for 120 pixels.
	Snipe: Instead of 380 pixels, the companion will only stay away from the target for 260 pixels.
Rococo's town npc will no longer attempt spawning on worlds where he isn't the starter companion.
	You will now need to recruit him from his recruitment npc.
Added a Comfort counter to the companions.
	Comfort counter will increase based on what the companion is doing, and depending on how many town npcs are nearby.
	It will not increase while the companion is in combat.
	Being in the Corruption and the Crimson will reduce the Comfort points gained by the companion.
	Invasions also reduces comfort gained by companions.
	The fear of the End of the World also greatly reduces the comfort acquisition.
	Blood Moons and Eclipses nullifies comfort acquisition.
Companions are no longer blood thristy. They will now only try attackin foes that gets near.
	When following your character, they will take in consideration their position, and your position when checking for threats.
The mod will no longer tell you when a companion has a new request for you.
	I did this change, because just by simply telling that the companion has a quest, will not only end up spoiling your gameplay, but also stressing you out.
	The only way of finding out If a companion has a request, is either by talking to It about requests, or checking the Guardian Selection Interface.
	Companions following you that has just unlocked a Talk request will still tell you that the request was unlocked.
Reviewed the body sprites of: Blue, Bree and Mabel.
