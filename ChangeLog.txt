Fixed a bug where the game spammed knock out message on companions that are already ko'd.
The companions head banners will now be drawn correctly on their houses.
Fixed an issue where you needed 2 characters created before you can have Portrait of a Friend spawn with a new character.
Fixed a bug where buddies couldn't be assigned a house.
Fixed another bug where certain infos were being saved when they shouldn't, like companion life time and their status.
Liebre will now comment something else when he saves the soul of a player who's his buddy, and dies on hardcore mode.
Companions will now mention when someone pick them as their buddy.
	If the person speaking to the companion, is the buddy of the companion that is mentioned the message, the message will change to a message from the companion to the player, instead.
Added a interface telling the current season, days and day of week. It's visible when inventory is opened.
	The time shown there is different from world time, so the time passed is irregular compared to the world.
	Think of this as a "Ether Realm time".
New worlds have the chance of spawning with more than one companion, depending on number of companions met on other characters, and your luck.
