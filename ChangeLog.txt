Companions will show up as standing when reviving someone who's being carried by another companion.

Revive system has changed:
	Now there is a specific counter for health recovery/damage.
	Everytime the counter reaches the maximum value, It will recover 5% health. The inverse also happens to the minimum value, which reduces 5% health.

	The revive boost will reduce the rate which bleeding will reduce character health.
