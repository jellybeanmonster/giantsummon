Companion folders were organized.
	Now TerraGuardians will be located inside Companions/Creatures, while Terrarians will be located inside Companions/Terrarians.
	A modder adding companions to this mod can setup a custom directory to their companion files by using SpriteDirectory variable, on GuardianBase. The folder name is still the companion name.
Companions now have messages they will say when rescuing someone.
Terrarian companions will now have their hair hidden if a mod item they're using has setup so.
Companions talk messages will now be told when you start dialogue with a companion, that has maxed out comfort points, and gains friendship exp.
Request system remade:
	The mod now has a database of possible requests, with their objectives and requirements.
	The system is now easier and direct about making new requests, and also has less irrelevant infos loaded on the memory.
	Completting the request now offers you 3 possible rewards. Each reward is generated once the request is created, by talking to the companion about it after the cooldown ends.
	The HasRequestMessages has been updated to support "[objective]" tag, so you can display a short description of the objective, before you can accept or reject it.
	Added 2 new messages, they are for when you complete the request, or talk to the companion about the request, and it isn't completed or failed.
	If you have less than 30 seconds to complete the quest when you talk to the npc about it, the game will give you exactly 30 seconds to pick your reward and complete it.
Wrath's npc hit counter variable now resets once it reaches the necessary amount of hits for him to take some measure.
Wrath's npc will now try using Body Slam when he gets a certain number of hits and shots.
Companions you have request active, will be able to visit you, regardless of if you enabled or not companion visit on your world.
	Failing a request because the npc didn't appeared sucks.
Miguel recruit npc no longer has the power of multiplication.
Since talk requests have been removed, their talk messages will show up when you speak to a companion that has full comfort point, about to rise friendship exp.
Changed how body parts of the Terrarian companions are drawn depending on equipments. Now they should work more like intended.
Companions will no longer sleeptalk feats they know people did.
There is now a delay of time before the bounty board updates its status.
	There is no need for the bounty board to have its text updated every frame.
	The bounty board will no longer show the exact time left. If the bounty will last hours, it will show only the hours. If it lasts minutes, It will only show the minutes.
