	Moved the arms a few pixels closer to the body, for the stopped and walking animations.
The mod will now show the correct amount of life crystals and life fruits used on the companions, when sharing the max health value.
	Before, let's say you have 5 life crystals used, but Rococo has only 2, It would show on the health bar that Rococo had used 5 life crystals.
Removed some stray pixels from Blue left arm that were showing above her hair.
Companions will no longer wake up after you finish talking with them.

Companions gained a boost in their view range.
Did some changes to the Zombie Guardian AI.
From the guardians you didn't allowed to move in your world, but their npcs is still present, they will leave the world at a time of day based on their daytime prefference.

Companions can no longer suffer fall damage when attached to a rope.
You can no longer speak with your companions when knocked out.
Bree recruit npc can also have a chance of appearing, if you've beaten the King Slime.
	That increases the chances of seeing her scold Sardine.

If you have the option of making your character enter knocked out cold state, when health drops during knock out state, the Grappling Hook key will no longer force your character to die, but will instead start the rescue countdown while you hold It.
Changed the effects that happens when your character is rescued.
	After your character is taken to a safe place, the screen bars will still be dark, and leave the screen as your character health is regenerated.
	A companion that has rescued you will say something, If they have a dialogue line for that.
Improved companions vertical range of sight for hostile monsters.
I may have fixed the problem where npcs that transforms from Terraria npc to Companion npcs would have their dialogue window closed.
Blue and Mabel recruitment are now more verbal, and less emotive.
	You didn't got It? Well, you'll need to speak with them, and then do their dialogues through a dialogue window, instead of waiting for them to say all they want, before you are able to recruit them.
	I don't know you guys, but the old way was annoying and took quite too long.

Guardian recruitable npcs will no longer slide when walking.
	I were multiplying the wrong variable :/
	Also fixed a few issues related to their frame calculation.
Added an option to the guardian npc dialogue to allow you to postpone a request a guardian can give you.
	The option will close the dialogue, but will cause no change to the quest Itself.
Your guardian can no longer jump while holding Down key.
Somewhat fixed a problem that caused the player to go higher or lower depending on your character position, when mounted on a companion.
	The problem is that the items will still show a bit offset, but not that much.
Companions you've already met on your other characters have a chance of appearing as a Starter Guardian when you enter a new world.
	I think that may improve replay value.
Talk requests will no longer force companions without enough friendship level to leave your party.
Starter guardians will no longer be dismissed upon completting requests requiring them, if you don't have the friendship level to call them.

Reviewed the text of a number of companions recruitment tip messages from the Dryad.
Added Malisha's recruitmemt tip to the Dryad.
