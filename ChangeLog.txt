Fixed a problem where I forgot the death rotation animation on companions.

Fixed Domino's store.
Companions data will no longer load with their recruit npcs data.
	That not only fixes the bug mentioned above, but also eases the memory usage of the mod.

Changed how the Mass of the companion works:
	Instead of changing how much the gravity affects the companion, It now affects their max fall speed.
