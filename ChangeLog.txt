Updated the victory scores of the companions based on latest popularity contest result.
Fixed an issue where Green and Miguel previously had victories, even though they only participated once.
Rummors companions destines to those who picked them as their buddies will now be shown correctly by them.
	They will never mention that they were picked as buddy by someone.
Fixed an issue where Minerva was showing as male.
Companions can no longer be pulled when they're lifting the player.
Inverted the negation state of the mount icon on the companion profile page. (Is this a good name?)
Changed the way Brutus warning appears. This way might fix a possible incidence of ignored crash causing message telling he showed up not to appear.
Fixed a bug where starter guardians would leave the world at their first oportunity.
Green can now fix wounds out of your character and companions.
Changed the method used for drawing the texts on companions dialogues.
Luna now can talk about Skills and Companions living in the world.
Added Tutorial Quest to the mod.
	Quest is named "Know More".
	Luna will assist you during that quest.
	That quest is entirelly used to explain about some mod features without reading the help dialogues she offers.
	This quest is impossible to complete. You can't stop learning, right?
Fixed Rococo's head equipment positioning.
Changed how the mod gets companion datas for their npcs.
	That also possibly fixes a crash with the companion selection interface on multiplayer.
Fixed a problem where the companion couldn't be pulled to you on multiplayer, without respawning them..
Removed useless test multiplayer sync config option.
Fixed a bug where the Broken Armor debuff given by the Zombie Guardian sword slash on expert mode only lasted half a second.
	Now it lasts 30 seconds, instead.
Minerva can now end up spawning during your travels, if not only her requirements are met, but also your friendship level with her is under 3 (which is the friendship level for you to be able to let her move in).
Cinnamon will still have the chance of appearing after the Travelling Merchant, even if you've met her before.
The changes on Minerva and Cinnamon spawning are useful for those who disabled companions visit.
Vladimir's free recruitment has been reworked:
	Before, you would gain Vladimir for free for starting a new character before the launch of Terraria 1.4.
	Now, you can get Vladimir if you enter a world with a character that you didn't recruited him yet, 14 days before Terraria's birthday, or on the day of Terraria's birthday.
