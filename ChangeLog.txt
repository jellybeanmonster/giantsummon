Fixed a bug where Green's message for when the player dies shows broken time values.
Fixed Daphne not having description.
You can now disable companion outfit, if you somehow manage to activate it when you didn't unlocked it.
Fixed a bug with the Meat Bag outfit quest:
	You no longer miss the +2 friendship points with Blue and Zacks.
	The mod now tells you that you unlocked the outfit, before the closing dialogue from Zacks.
Added the Contributed Companion tag to the pig guardians.
Luna will no longer spawn on places with background walls.
	That way, she will avoid spawning inside caves.
Fixed an issue with quest dialogues and their participant lists having issues.
	That was causing blue to do monologue with herself on "Let's Patch it Up!" quest.
Miguel now runs faster.
