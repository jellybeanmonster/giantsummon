Tried making It easier for you to find Alex in the world, now he'll spawn:
	On the Surface.
	Some place without walls.
	Non corrupted zones.
	Non sloped or half block tiles.
	He'll appear on Lifeform Analyzer.
Also did changes to his recruit npc.
	Alex no longer has eagle eyes. he can no longer find you before you find him.
Sardine's Cait Sith outfit added to the mod.
	Help him to be able to flip It on.
Domino will no longer stalk you trying to move into your world, whenever you send him home.
Companions will now try using the Space Gun, whenever they are wearing the Meteor set, and they are waiting for mana to recharge.
Companions walking will now have their animation run 3 times faster, to make their movement look less weird.
I did the following changes to companion recruitments:
	Now recruiting the companions for the first time, will rise their friendship level to 1.
		This prevents you meeting the companions twice, and avoiding having to do their request to be able to increase their friendship level.
	When the scene where Leopold notices the TerraGuardians ends, your character will not automatically get him on your companion list, but also get a friendship level.
Bounty Requests now have the chance of giving weapons and accessories as rewards, but currently, only pre hardmode weapons and accessories will be given.
On the old order interface, you can now send your companions to sell items without the necessity of having a magic mirror in their inventory.
