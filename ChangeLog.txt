Companion folders were organized.
	Now TerraGuardians will be located inside Companions/Creatures, while Terrarians will be located inside Companions/Terrarians.
	A modder adding companions to this mod can setup a custom directory to their companion files by using SpriteDirectory variable, on GuardianBase. The folder name is still the companion name.
Companions now have messages they will say when rescuing someone.
Terrarian companions will now have their hair hidden if a mod item they're using has setup so.
