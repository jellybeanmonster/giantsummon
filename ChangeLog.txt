	Due to this change, his health will go to 0 when knocked out.
	While Knocked out, he can't attract aggro, or be hurt by monsters.
Fixed Wrath's floating effect not working when being controlled by the player.
Irene's tombstone will no longer spawn above trees.
	That also caused the tombstone spawning system to have their old bugs, but It's better than being in a tree.

	Also increased the time it takes for the generation failed text to remain shown.
