Tweaked some more the companion targetting AI.
You can no longer spam give gifts to your companions through their dialogues.
Domino will no longer sell you Stynger bolts when you have Stingers (which drops from Hornets in the Underground Jungle) in your inventory.
Changed Brutus dialogue a bit on Domino's "Mysterious Package" request.
Companions will now be drawn on by the world when their owner player is petrified.
	That will fix the issue where companions simply disappear when your character is petrified.
Companions should now be petrified on the correct conditions, now.
