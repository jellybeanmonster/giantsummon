Possibly fixed an issue where the game would have consecutive crashing.
Bounty targets now spawns easier.
Boosted the chance of rare accessories appearing on bounty quests.
Companions will no longer insist in trying to use furniture someone else is using.
Captain Stench's recruitment npc will no longer persist in the world after you leave It.
Fixed a resource disposing bug.
Fixed an issue with the system of disposing textures when mod reloads.
Terrarian companions can now have extra texture data loaded.
Fixed constant crashes that happened on multiplayer.
	That doesn't means that multiplayer is 100% playable. I don't recommend joining It for a serious playthrough, since gathering new companions wont be possible.
Added companion reactions to:
	Teleporting Home, When Someone Joins Team, When Player Meets Someone New, Companion Invokes a Minion and When Player is Hugged by Vladimir Recruit Npc.
