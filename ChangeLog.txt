Nerfed companions view range:
	It went from 520x480 to 360x320.
Recipes will no longer spoil your shopping on Domino's store.
Nerfed damage penalty for having more than 1 companion.

Alex recruit npc now gives you some more time to read his final recruitment line.
Rococo recruit npc will now face the one he's speaking with.
Vladimir recruit npc will now be able to spot players in his view range.
	That will stop him from wandering around, and speaking random lines.
You can now change how the companions will call you.
	Not all dialogues have the companions call you a Terrarian, but... That's a change.
You can no longer control Terrarian characters.
Added a turn lock to the companions.
	The turn lock will add a delay before companions can turn to the other direction, after just turning.
Did a few tweaks to the wall slide functionality on the companions.
Companions will now be affected by Dryad's Blessing/Bane.
The Portrait of a Friend will no longer give you free 15 golds.
The Portrait of a Friend will now correctly disappear from the inventory when you pass 12 minutes of gameplay.
Fixed two bugs related to player reviving a companion:
	One is the bug where the text flickers, the other is not being able to revive companion when there's no town npc nearby.
You can now ask companions to join your team, or leave your team through their dialogues.
	Due to this change, the Call and Dismiss button on the Guardian Selection Interface will still be disponible for you to use.
		Did I scare you right now?
Added a fail safe checking on the companion dialogue update script. If the game manages to generate a dialogue without option, It will add the "Close" option to It.
Removed the friendship level related messages from the companions.
	Ever since I added them, I felt very awkward, and were unable to add an actually fitting message for a friendship level up. There are better approaches for friendship level up.
Added some more special dialogue entries for companions.
	There are for:
		Leopold's recruitment (the 3 dialogues where the companion leader speaks to him).
		For when you add or removes the companion from the group, through dialogue.
Companions will not only try facing the one they're reviving, based on which direction their left arm is closer to, but also will keep a 8 pixels distance from the one they're reviving.
