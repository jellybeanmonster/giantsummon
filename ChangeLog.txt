Companions will no longer mindlessly jump when walking on platforms.
Companions will now correctly get off dangerous tiles when stepping on them.
Fixed a bug where the mod wasn't recognizing companions with full life crystal health, when they tried to use life fruits, and shared max health is turned on.
Fixed a bug where actions that were cancellable were not being cancelled, because of using the wrong action object.
