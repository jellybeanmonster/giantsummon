Added Shaded Body skin from PigmanDelta to Rococo.
	The skin has no unlock requirement, so you can change It anytime.
Having DPS debuffs afflicting your character will also trigger the rescue.
	Normally, such buffs wouldn't last long enough for your character to need rescue, but Red Potion exists.
When your character is mounted on a companion, and your character gets knocked out, the companion will try placing your character on the floor to help on the recovery, when there is no danger nearby.
	Due to this, the 3 revive boost the guardian used to give when your character is ko'd while mounted, was reduced to 1.
Having your character rescued, will remove debuffs afflicting It.
Fixed a bug where after your character is rescued, the screen remains blacked out until your character wakes up.
The character will now close their eyes when knocked out.
Your character will spawn at the rescue spot with only 1 hp.
	Dead companions will respawn too.
	Knocked out companions will not only leave Knocked Out Cold state, but will have their health set to a random value upon respawning.
Added the Two Handed Mastery accessory to the mod.
	It allows companions having It equipped to dual wield weapons.
	Since Domino's shop is not showing mod items, Sardine's Bounty Quests will have a chance of having that item as one of the rewards.
		I may not change that.
The button of forcing rescue now works.
Knocked out Terrarian companions will no longer levitate on the floor.

	She will no longer be under heavy effect of Terraria's built in npc offset. (She may still be a few pixels off when under the floor.)
	She will now only follow your character, when you're speaking with her.
	Removed an unused variable declaration.
		It was from the old recruitment dialogue.
The friendship advancement messages will now by default be empty, so guardians that doesn't have such messages, will never show them.
	I was actually thinking about removing It entirelly, but who knows, someone must like to see a proof that friendship improved.
Changed a bit the companion met tutorial message, to be less referent to TerraGuardians, and more about introducing their GSI.
To avoid abrupt dialogue end between Guardian recruit npc > companion town npc, I added a 60 frames timer to ignore distancing of the companion.
	This should make so dialogues aren't closed when the companion recruit npc transforms into town npc.
Reduced the range the nearby companion town npcs will reduce the spawn rate of monsters.
Companions will now recognize nearby companion town npcs as town npcs.
Town npc companions will now be teleported to their houses when you are far away from them, and they are knocked out.

	The upper half of the health bar will show the life crystal/life fruits your companions used.
	The lower half of the health bar will show the shared life crystal value the companion gained from your character.
	Passing the mouse over the health bar will show the shared life crystal and fruit values.
Shared mana crystals are displayed too.
It's now possible to change the draw layers of the companion head, on their GuardianBase script.
	This allows to changing the head sprite of the companion when there is a skin in use.
Increased the chance of companions visiting your world.
There is no perception range check when Bree recruit npc spawns, so the game will always tell when she spawns near your character.
Companions will try jumping whenever they are about to reach the floor and receive fall damage.
Companions will have their mass disregarded whenever they use a Rocket Boot or a Cloud in a Bottle type item.
	That may cause the accessories to do their intended effects.
Companions gained 2 extra situational dialogues:
	They will speak something when knocked out, and when sleeping.
	The problem of the knocked out dialogue, is that It will never trigger, because you can't speak with knocked out companions.
Did a few tweaks on some of Rococo Sprites.
	Did some changes to the arm sprites on his attack animations.
	Also did some changes to the body sprites on some of the attack animations.
		Sorry PigmanDelta. Beside that wont break Rococo skin.
	The heavy swing and kneeling animations had some changes on some of the arm sprites, and also the body and legs.
		The body was made a bit more curved on the back, so Rococo no longer seems flat when his body is lowered.
		I did some changes to the leg sprites of It too, making the animation look better, and make more sense.
		Readjusted the position of the arms on some frames. That will of course affect weapon placement when attacking, but will be minimal. Probably.
	I also changed his Throne Sitting animation sprites.
		The arms positioning now makes sense.
		Removed stray pixels from his head.
		Did some changes to his legs sprites.
Brutus will do comments whenever your character health reaches 30%.

	Due to him being unable to heal your character in this state, he'll give you a small revive boost.

	That also allows you to suicide your character too, in case there is no possibility of rescue.

	Those actions will be disabled whenever you dismiss them, in a safe way to avoid bugs.

	You can try Buddy Mode on a new character, once you have at least 1 character created on your computer.
	The character will spawn with an item, that item will remain in the inventory for 12 in-game hours (12 real life minutes).
	Upon using such item, It will open a window allowing you to pick the companion your character you will be bound with.

	They will also try closing the door whenever they are stopped, if they opened It.
