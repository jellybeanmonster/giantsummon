Companion folders were organized.
	Now TerraGuardians will be located inside Companions/Creatures, while Terrarians will be located inside Companions/Terrarians.
	A modder adding companions to this mod can setup a custom directory to their companion files by using SpriteDirectory variable, on GuardianBase. The folder name is still the companion name.
Companions now have messages they will say when rescuing someone.
Terrarian companions will now have their hair hidden if a mod item they're using has setup so.
Companions talk messages will now be told when you start dialogue with a companion, that has maxed out comfort points, and gains friendship exp.
Request system remade:
	The mod now has a database of possible requests, with their objectives and requirements.
	The system is now easier and direct about making new requests, and also has less irrelevant infos loaded on the memory.
	Completting the request now offers you 3 possible rewards. Each reward is generated once the request is created, by talking to the companion about it after the cooldown ends.
	The HasRequestMessages has been updated to support "[objective]" tag, so you can display a short description of the objective, before you can accept or reject it.
	Added 2 new messages, they are for when you complete the request, or talk to the companion about the request, and it isn't completed or failed.
