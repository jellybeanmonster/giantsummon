Tweaked some more the companion targetting AI.

Domino will no longer sell you Stynger bolts when you have Stingers (which drops from Hornets in the Underground Jungle) in your inventory.
Changed Brutus dialogue a bit on Domino's "Mysterious Package" request.
Companions will now be drawn on by the world when their owner player is petrified.
	That will fix the issue where companions simply disappear when your character is petrified.

Improved companions aging and growth process.
	Now the companions aging will be based on a timer in the player, so the player controls how old they are.
	Companions younger than 18 years old will now appear smaller.
	Added the possibility of changing a companion group aging speed.
		That doesn't means they will have birthday parties more frequently. Their birthday will still happen every 32 days.
	The Cait Sith companions have now their own group, with a different aging process:
		They will age 367% faster than the other TerraGuardians.
		This group affects Sardine and Bree.

	That is to avoid them swinging their weapons to the oposite direction of their target.

Giant Dog Guardians has also got their own group.

Fixed a problem where Alex would stop using his left arm to attack while the player is mounted.
Updated the sprite of Sardine that shows when he's inside the King Slime.
Expanded Rococo's dialogues.
Added a button to the Guardian Selection Interface, to take you to the wiki page of the companions.

Added some missing dialogues to new companions, related to Leopold recruitment.
Removed the dialogue option of removing companion from party when the player is on Buddies mode.
	I added a few extra lines of codes when loading save. Now the game should force your buddy to show up, in case you dismissed It.
Companions will no longer simply disappear just because your character turned into a ghost.
	Companions will also start their idle AI when your character is dead.
Some companions will not sleep while at bed, so you can speak with them right away.
	Zacks is an example of those kinds of companions.
You will no longer receive messages telling you that your Starter Guardian can now be called, due to friendship level increasing.
	Starter Guardians are always willing to follow you.
Further improved the move in level requirement, making so Starter Guardians no longer refuse to move in or anything If you didn't met their friendship level.
Setting companions to "Avoid Combat" no longer means "dumb" in combat.
	They will also now less likelly attract monster aggro in that state, too.
	Due to each combat row having their own defined distances, you can now set them up when the companion is using this.
Having Vladimir follow you doesn't means he will instantly stop giving you a hug.
