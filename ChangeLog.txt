Blue no longer has the arms looking like they are dislodged.
	Moved the arms a few pixels closer to the body, for the stopped and walking animations.
The mod will now show the correct amount of life crystals and life fruits used on the companions, when sharing the max health value.
	Before, let's say you have 5 life crystals used, but Rococo has only 2, It would show on the health bar that Rococo had used 5 life crystals.
Removed some stray pixels from Blue left arm that were showing above her hair.
Companions will no longer wake up after you finish talking with them.
Guardians now revives others faster.
Companions now have the ability of dual wielding.
	Domino comes naturally with that ability.
	Dual Wielding reduces the damage of the weapons by 20%.
	Dual Wield will not work if the companion is holding an offhand item.
Fixed a confusion that can happen when you give life/ether crystal/fruit to your companion when you have the option of sharing the max life with your companions.
Companions will not dare to attack creatures in their reflect projectile state.
