Added Shaded Body skin from PigmanDelta to Rococo.
	The skin has no unlock requirement, so you can change It anytime.
Having DPS debuffs afflicting your character will also trigger the rescue.
	Normally, such buffs wouldn't last long enough for your character to need rescue, but Red Potion exists.
When your character is mounted on a companion, and your character gets knocked out, the companion will try placing your character on the floor to help on the recovery, when there is no danger nearby.
	Due to this, the 3 revive boost the guardian used to give when your character is ko'd while mounted, was reduced to 1.
Having your character rescued, will remove debuffs afflicting It.
Fixed a bug where after your character is rescued, the screen remains blacked out until your character wakes up.
The character will now close their eyes when knocked out.
Your character will spawn at the rescue spot with only 1 hp, but all your companions will be out of knocked out state.
	Dead companions will respawn too.
Added the Two Handed Mastery accessory to the mod.
	It allows companions having It equipped to dual wield weapons.
	Since Domino's shop is not showing mod items, Sardine's Bounty Quests will have a chance of having that item as one of the rewards.
		I may not change that.
The button of forcing rescue now works.
Knocked out Terrarian companions will no longer levitate on the floor.
Did some changes to Mabel recruit npc:
	She will no longer be under heavy effect of Terraria's built in npc offset. (She may still be a few pixels off when under the floor.)
	She will now only follow your character, when you're speaking with her.
	Removed an unused variable declaration.
		It was from the old recruitment dialogue.
The friendship advancement messages will now by default be empty, so guardians that doesn't have such messages, will never show them.
	I was actually thinking about removing It entirelly, but who knows, someone must like to see a proof that friendship improved.
Changed a bit the companion met tutorial message, to be less referent to TerraGuardians, and more about introducing their GSI.
