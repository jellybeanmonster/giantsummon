Fargo's sign image bellow the inventory interface will no longer obstruct first companion face.
Increased the chance of Cinnamon appear when her recruit npc requirement is met.
Fixed a bug where Vladimir's arms were shown as carrying someone, when he's knocked out.
Fluffles tail will now correctly be shown in front of the mount, when the player is sharing mount with her.
Fixed Glenn's helmet placement.
Companions that just was woke up by the player will now look at them.
Fixed a positioning issue characters carried by Vladimir were having.
	Now they should stay in his arms correctly, instead of having signs of "acceleration" and "deceleration" when he's in movement.
Companions will now react to Honey buff.
Fluffles will now be invisible when she's exposed to daylight, and she isn't close to you.
	She will have only 10% opacity if she's in your team.
Added new companion reactions to:
	When player dies,
	When player is knocked out,
	When an ally is knocked out,
	When spots a rare loot,
	When leaving to sell loot,
	When the player is at a dangerous health level (< 30%),
	When the companion is at a dangerous health level (< 30%),
	When running out of potions (Has 4 left on the inventory),
	When just runs out of potions (Used the last one),
	When spots a boss,
	When defeats a boss,
	When a invasion begins,
	When an invasion ends,
	When an event begins (Eclipse, Blood Moon, Moon events),
	When an event ends (^).
Added Common Status system for companions.
	That system allows things from companions, like life crystals used, mana crystals and skill progress of each companion to be the same for any character.
	You can turn it on or off any time on the settings.
	Upon opening the game at least once, the game will try populating the Common Status infos, based on the highest value of health, mana and skills companions you've met have.
		The status will not be updated again after that. Their progress will diverge, so I recommend you to focus on either playing with or without the system.
Changed how companions scale change effect works.
