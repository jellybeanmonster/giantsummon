Did some little fixes to Mabel's left arm sprites.
	The connection with the body now gives the idea that there's a shoulder in the way.
	This also allowed me to find out that the left arm color, was disconnected from the arm, when she was kneeling on the floor.
You can no longer abuse of the not following companions inability of consuming items, to easily max out their health and mana.
Companions now knows that Lihzahrd and Lihzahrd Crawlers are the same monster, so request requiring them will count them as killed.
Companions will now take in consideration the player controlling guardians when checking if the player is afk or not.
	That will also fix the bug where Brutus tele-protects the player when controlling a companion.
Fixed a number of cases where the companion aim position wasn't set to their center, upon spawning.
	That issue could cause companions not to use ranged attacks because their cursor was trying to catch up on them.
Fixed Domino's right arm not being correctly colored when using a chair.
Fixed Mabel's left arm outline not being shown when sleeping?
Companions will no longer have their combat behavior AI work only when they aren't using an item.
All companions will now show their messages correctly.
Companions will now correctly try going home, and using their house furnitures when there.
The mod will now better know the furnitures at a companion house.
	Possibly now will avoid companion using furnitures from other's house.
	That will also make them try using furnitures at their houses, when It's not sleep time.
Postponing a companion request will now have their reply parsed.
Malisha got some fixes on her leg sprites.
	I think I'll have to work on It again later.
You can now have 7 companions following you.
	You need Friendship Rank 32 to unlock that.
