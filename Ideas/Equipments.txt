The Guardians should have their own weapons, crafted for their own use, and also fitting their size.
They could have also their own accessories and equipments, the outfit equipments could give them alongside extra status, 
but also give them a new look.

There could also have accessories that gives the guardians some extra abilities to benefit themselves or the player 
who summoned them, like a Cover accessory, that adds the chance of the Guardian taking a hit for the player.
For further idea, the accessories could also level up, or not.
