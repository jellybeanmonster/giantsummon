If you plan on trying to make a better sprite for the companions in the mod, please, DO NOT replace the original files.
In case I make a new feature, or need to adjust the sprite because of animation problems, I will have problems because 
the sprite is a lot more complex to build. In case you want to make a new sprite for the character, either use a new and 
different layer (or group on Asepra), or create a folder and place there the modified sprites you made.
