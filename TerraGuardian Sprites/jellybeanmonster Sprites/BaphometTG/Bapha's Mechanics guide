Bapha's Mechanics guide:
Key:
HS-Hell Splitter
ES-Embered State
CF- Crimson Flame
HF-Hell Flame
HP-Hell Portal

Combat:
Embered State(Passive)- When Bapha is nearby any fire blocks or liquid that emit heat he becomes empowered with flames and gains extra capabilites as described below.
-Bapha is unaffected by all fire debuffs and does not take damage from lava or fire blocks.
-When embered Bapha's health regeneration rate increases 

Attacks-
>Hell Splitter- Fire formed blade that slashes twice in one attack dealing 25 base damage each and applies "On Fire" debuff/ "Cursed Inferno" debuff depending if bapha is embered or not.
-HS scales with current weapon equiped dealing 1.5x damage of what the weapon wouldve originally did.
-HS does not scale with weapon speed, it is a static attack speed that cannot be changed in anyway by the player(Its damage makes up for the inability to raise attack speed)
-HS properties change when embered, changing vfx of HS and causing HS to apply cursed inferno when attacking enemies.

>Hell Flame- Fire ball that does 20 base damage by itself with no weapon equiped.
-(Base damage stacks with whatever current weapon damage is but does not scale with weapon damage)

>Crimson Flame- Crimson fire ball that does 40 base damage and causes enemies to gain the "Cursed Inferno" Debuff when getting hit.
-CF can only be used when Bapha is in ES.
-(Base damage stacks with whatever current weapon damage is but does not scale with weapon damage)
