Bapha's Mechanics guide:
Key:
HS-Hell Splitter
ES-Embered State
CF- Crimson Flame
HF-Hell Flame
HP-Hell Portal

Combat:
Embered State(Passive)- When Bapha is nearby any fire blocks or liquid that emit heat he becomes empowered with flames and gains extra capabilites as described below.

Mixed fighter that is capable of attacking both ranged and melee.
Attacks-
>Hell Splitter- Fire formed blade that slashes twice in one attack dealing 25 base damage and applies "On Fire" debuff/ "Cursed Inferno" debuff depending if bapha is embered or not.
-HS scales with current weapon equiped dealing 1.2x damage of what the weapon wouldve originally did.
-HS does not scale with weapon speed, it is a static attack speed that cannot be changed in anyway by the player(Its damage makes up for the inability to raise attack speed)
-HS properties change when embered, changing vfx of HS and causing HS to apply cursed inferno when attacking enemies.

>Hell Flame- Fire ball that does 20 base damage by itself with no weapon equiped.
-(Base damage stacks with whatever current weapon damage is but does not scale with weapon damage)

>Crimson Flame- Crimson fire ball that does 40 base damage and causes enemies to gain the "Cursed Inferno" Debuff when getting hit.
-CF can only be used when Bapha is in ES.
-(Base damage stacks with whatever current weapon damage is but does not scale with weapon damage)
