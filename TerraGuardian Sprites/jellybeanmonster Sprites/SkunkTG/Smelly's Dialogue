Player Choices: A/B/C

First Meeting:

1."Hello there stranger, I'm captain smelly and my ship was hit by this big rock here while I was scouting this planet.My cadets were tragically killed during the crash and im the only survivor. 
Before landing here I was scouting this planet and there seems to be lots of rare and useful materials underneath the soil, yeah?"

Choices> (A)Yes there is

2."Do you by any chance have some rare metals like gold or platinum?"
"If you do it would really help me out as my equipment is damaged from the crash and i am unable to defend myself. If you give me 15 gold and platinum bars I will be in debt to you and a VERY useful companion if needed."

Choices> (A)Give materials/(B)I dont have the materials right now/C No

3. A Response(Recruit)- Thank you, these materials will be put to good use. Rest assured you won't be disappointed. Now then im ready for adventure when you are.
3. B/C Response(Conditions not met)- Oh that's unfortunate. IF you ever stumble apon the metals please consider supplying them to me as I will be left stranded and defenseless here on a foriegn planet.

After recruited(General/Self dialogue):

-Before coming to this planet i was a space pirate captain, going around taking things from other worlds.
-My weapons are a plasma falchion and arm blaster. I stole both from a ship me and my crew hijacked while traversing space.
-Unfortunately I am the only one who survived the crash of my ship. My cadets won't get to enjoy the treasures we will find.
-My plasma falchion seems to have a empty socket for a gemstone to fit in wonder what it would do?
-If you ever come across any gemstones make sure to share them with me. I want to find out the true power of my blade.
-Forgot to mention my phantasm device has taken damage also if you have any spare platinum/gold bars you could help fix it. 20 bars is all it would need.
