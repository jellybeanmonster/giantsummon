Instead of adding dialogues to dismiss a companion when in their recruitment, instead make so the companion is added to the companion list, but not set to spawn on the world.
Add a method that damages the ko'd health recovery, also halting health regen effect from allies, and can kill the one having the ko health damage when It reaches 0.
Add a skin and outfit container to the game, so other mod skins and outfits can be added to the mod.
	The container also should have a hook for the drawing scripts, if there isn't already in the mod.

Companion grouping system.
	The grouping system will be used by the house finder, to tell which guardians can share their room with the other guardian.
	Should check if there's enough chairs for them to move in.
Blue should get an animation for when she's knocked out, while having a bunny.
Starter guardians should use starter items, don't you think?
Change the first stage of Knockout, to make so the character is sitting down on the floor, but still able to attack.
	Of course, there should be an animation for that.
Add an animation where the companion sits on the floor.
	When the player is mounted on it, maybe the guardian could sit by pressing a key.
	Please be Insert... Please be Insert...
When the player has at least 5 companions following him, offer the possibility of giving the name to their company.
	That doesn't means the player may end up going on a war in the future, but would be cool to name your group.
	Who could offer that possibility? Brutus?
Companions that are couple should not only be able to share the same bed, but have their own sleeping animation for that occasion.
	I need to setup who is going to be drawn first too, would be weird if I make an animation where a character is hugging another, and the one who's hugging is drawn in front of the other.
Split Bree's bag from the body sprite.
	When I manage to add Bree's dress, It would be a waste of space making a sprite with and without the bag.
Add a skin to Zacks where his body wounds have bandages, and he's wearing a cuff.
	The skin should be unlocked with the help of Blue's requests.
	The shirt should have "Meat Bag" written. There is no way of displaying that, so better add that to the skin description.
Implement an alternative mount position, for when the player is inside blocks while mounted on the guardian shoulders.
Add an option to turn off the damage downscaling when using multiple companions.
Fix Irene tombstone spawn place.
Add Rest option to the companions dialogue.
	The option should only appear, either if the player is inside a valid house, or if the player is near It's bed.
	This option not only allows you to skip part of the day, but also rests the companions on the team, if you have the necessities system on.
Those companions needs an alternative recruitment method for those who are playing on Buddy Mode.
	Zacks, Domino.
