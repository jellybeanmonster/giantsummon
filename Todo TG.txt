Instead of adding dialogues to dismiss a companion when in their recruitment, instead make so the companion is added to the companion list, but not set to spawn on the world.
Add a method that damages the ko'd health recovery, also halting health regen effect from allies, and can kill the one having the ko health damage when It reaches 0.
Add a skin and outfit container to the game, so other mod skins and outfits can be added to the mod.
	The container also should have a hook for the drawing scripts, if there isn't already in the mod.

Companion grouping system.
	The grouping system will be used by the house finder, to tell which guardians can share their room with the other guardian.
	Should check if there's enough chairs for them to move in.
Add the possibility of companions that can't live in the world, come visit It to spend the day.
	Add an option to allow turning It off, that may be helpful for low end players.
Blue should get an animation for when she's knocked out, while having a bunny.
Make companion npcs be able to share the same house, there should be some info on their Guardian Base that tells who they may share house with. Or a third info that tells who can live with who, to avoid bugs and confusion.
Zacks seems to have a problem with his throne sitting animation, related to the outline of his right arm.
	Where have I seen that before?
