A young orphan that in her youth was adopted by a Royal Family, but was outcasted by the very same.
Currently she lives from what she finds in the Forest, and even though there's Townsfolk that visit her, 
she spends most of her time alone, with the constant reminder of what she did that day, and the fear of hurting someone else.
Tends to use a Leaf Cape to hide herself from people.
