The way I envision her, she used to be part of Royalty, but got outcasted.
She lives in the forest outside the kingdom, surving from Fruits and Bugs.
She got scarred from outside people after the townsfolk demaded her dead for attacking the prince.
She is very Atletic and an Expert Bow Girl.
She is looking for info of what happened to her biological parents.
She loves her pet Firefly.
She is timid and easily to scare, but when in trust she becomes quite charming.

Yeah, she went full predator on her adopted brother, who is the prince of the Vegetarian
No, but she damaged his reputation( The prince is a Deer, Cille damaged his antleers ripping one of them, the Antleer 
are like the crown of the kingdom)
