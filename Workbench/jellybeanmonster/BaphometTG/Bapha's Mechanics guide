4. Player must accept Bapha's condtions for recruitment in order to have him on team

Basics:
-Bapha is unaffected by all fire debuffs and does not take damage from lava or fire blocks.
-When "Awakened" Bapha's health regeneration rate increases by 2.0x as well as healing for knocked out players and other terra gaurdian entities.(Recruited version only does not apply to boss form)
-Bapha takes 5x increased damage when wet or submerged in water additionally can not activate Awakened Form.(Rain included)
-When Baphas health reaches 0 on surface or any other place besides hell, his body desintagrates and gets sent back to hell. He reforms back in 20 seconds.
-If Bapha is recruited and his health reaches 0 while in underworld, his respawn timer gets set to 5 seconds instead of 20.


Buffs/Debuffs/Passive:
>Demonic Presence(Passive)- Bapha attracts hostile hell creatures to periodically spawn close to where he is.(10% Chance)(35% in boss form)

>Awakened Form(Buff->1:00 duration/permanent if in underworld)-Automatically activates while in underworld or activates after killing 10 foes within 10 seconds anywhere else.Bapha gains extra capabilites and new aesthetic as described below.(Buff is affected by "Soul Sacrifice")

>(New)Crimson ignite(Passive)- Bapha's attacks deal additional 5% damage to enemies effected by any fire debuff, including "Crimson Conflagration"

>(New)Crimson Conflagration(Debuff)(Awakened form only)- Flame that does 1% max health damage every second and last for 10 seconds + cannot be cured or put out at all + Lowers defense by 15 + Spreads to other enemies in 5 block radius

>Terrorized(Boss version debuff only)- Players cannot escape underworld until bapha is defeated, if they do leave a portal will appear at their location and instantly kill them with the message of "[player] was sent back to hell"

>Diablo numeral(debuff)- if both projectiles from "CMS" manage to hit the same target the target receives additonal 666 true damage.(Symbol appears letting the player know if this debuff has been activated)

>Soul Sacrifice (dialogue passive)- The player can sacrifice other terra guardians to Bapha for an increase in his Hp/Mp by 1.2x for each companion and it affects the "Awakened Form" buff by decreasing the amount of enemies needed to achieve the form by 1 for each companion sacrificed.
-(If the player manages to sacrifice 10 terra guardians then Bapha will be permanently in Awakened Form any where in the world)
-(The terragaurdians sacrificed can be ressurected through a dialogue with Bapha)
-(Terraguardians that are sacrificed are effected by the trust system towards players, so if they are revived then they will immediately be negative towards player which makes a lot of sense in this case instead of them being mad at player because they get killed own their own in some reandom way like falling to death)

>Negates fall damage(Passive)
