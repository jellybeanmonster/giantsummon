Basics:
-Bapha is unaffected by all fire debuffs and does not take damage from lava or fire blocks.
-When "Awakened" Bapha's health regeneration rate increases by 2.0x as well as healing for knocked out players and other terra gaurdian entities.(Recruited version only does not apply to boss form)
-Bapha takes 5x increased damage when wet or submerged in water additionally can not activate Awakened State.(Rain included)
-When baphas health reaches 0 on surface or any other place besides hell, his body desintagrates and gets sent back to hell. He reforms back in 10 seconds.
-If Bapha is recruited and his health reaches 0 while in underworld, his respawn timer gets set to 5 seconds instead of 10.


Buffs/Debuffs/Passive:
>Demonic Presence(Passive)- Bapha attracts hell creatures to periodically spawn close to where he is.(10% Chance)(35% in boss form) / also -All underworld enemies are non-hostile to Bapha(if thats possible to code in)
>Awakened Form(Buff->1:30 duration/permanent if in underworld)-Automatically activates while in underworld or activates after killing 10 foes anywhere else. Gains extra capabilites as described below.(Gains new aesthetic)
>(New)Crimson ignite(Debuff)(Awakened form only)- While in Awakened form Bapha takes away any and all fire resistance a enemy has(Immunities to fire debuffs) and does additional 5% damage to enemies effected by any fire debuff, including "Crimson Conflagration"
>(New)Crimson Conflagration(Debuff)(Awakened form only)- Flame that does 1% max health true damage every second and last for 10 seconds + cannot be cured or put out at all + Lowers defense by 15 + Spreads to other enemies in 5 block radius
>Terrorized(Boss version debuff only)- Players cannot escape underworld until bapha is defeated, if they do leave a portal will appear at their location and instantly kill them with the message of "[player] was sent back to hell"
>Diablo numeral(debuff)- if both projectiles from "Scarlet shredder" manage to hit the same target the target receives 666 true damage.(Symbol appears letting the player know if this debuff has been activated)
>Negates Fall Damage(Passive)
