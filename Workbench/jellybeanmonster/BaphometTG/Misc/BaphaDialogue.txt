Ailora(Scripted Dialogue for first meeting each other)-
Bapha: "Ailora! Impressive your still alive, the immortality was useful afterall hahaha!"
Ailora: "Yes of course! Almighty, after you were sealed during the God war I was forced into hiding as to not be executed by the opposing forces."
Bapha: "Ahhhh yes!!! now I remember. *Sadistic Laughter*... Ha! those weaklings they couldnt defeat me so they sealed me for several millennia. I'll have my revenge soon enough."
Ailora: "I could not find the the remaining apprentices, it seems like they were wiped out by the Divine order and Cthulhus dominion unfortunately."
Ailora: Cthulu was defeated by dryads and one Terrarian known as "The Guide". His organs were ripped out and scattered through out the world. The divine order seems to have disapeared leaving behind beings known as harpies.
Ailora: "My eyes have witnessed many civilizations since their rise and fall throughout thousands of years and I have learned so much as a result.
Ailora: "The world at this time is a blank slate for terrarians. The last war between mortals almost costed them extiction and now the population you see is but a atom of what it once was."
Bapha: "Seems like the divine order couldnt stop them from destruction after all *Sadistic laughter*"
Bapha: "With both of my adversaries gone,that means Terraria is all the easier to rule HAHAHAHAHAHA!."
Ailora: "I wouldnt be so sure of that as their are dangerous new creatures that were born as a side effect of conflict. Corrupted amalgamations, Bloody monstrosities,colorful horned horses and many more now traverse the land."
Ailora: "New land masses and environments have bloomed. I have yet to experience them all."
Bapha:  "With me back in action no one will stand a chance!"
