Layer/Frame note:
The holster and the gun on hip are seperate layers.
This is so when the gun is in use the gun layer can be turned off to give the effect of it actully being tooken out of holster.
So far i have only split the holster and gun into seperate layers. If need be let me know if i literally have to make duplicate frames of the character sprite in all cases such as walk run etc without the pistol holstered.
