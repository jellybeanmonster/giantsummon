Tired of playing Terraria alone? Let the TerraGuardians accompany you.

The TerraGuardians are mythical humanoid creatures that lives in the Ether 
Realm, and for some reason now they are moving to Terrarian worlds.

Befriend TerraGuardians, and they will help you, and also try to find out 
what is happening to cause them to appear.

There are quite a number of guardians you can find during your gameplay, 
each with their way of recruitment. Rise the friendship level, the more 
friendship level, the better for you.

You can also leave them guarding your houses, to protect your citizens, 
and do their requests for rewards.
